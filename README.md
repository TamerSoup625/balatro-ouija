# Ouija - Cryptid expansion for vanilla items
This mod will aim to unbalance vanilla features (like pre-existing Jokers and Consumables) to go along with [Cryptid](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1219749193204371456).

You can access the stable releases [here](https://github.com/TamerSoup625/balatro-ouija/releases) or click the big Code button above to download the latest one.

Right now the mod is in alpha state but I would really like to know anyway what you think about this mod. Thanks!

## Known Issues
- The mod does not check if certain Cryptid features are enabled or not, so you may get crashes if you disabled some.
- The current method of adding features is pretty bad, I know. The next release will allow you to keep modded items along with vanilla ones.
