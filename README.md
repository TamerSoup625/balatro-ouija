# Ouija - Cryptid expansion for vanilla items
This mod will aim to unbalance vanilla features (like pre-existing Jokers and Consumables) to go along with [Cryptid](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1219749193204371456).

NOTE: The mod is in a very early stage, stay here only if you want to contribute with Pull Requests.
